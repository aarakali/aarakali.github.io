# Introduction

This is the website where I record all my prior and ongoing data (and other online) projects. 

# About Me
I am currently a PhD Student in Public and Urban Policy at The New School, New York, United States. My home is in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of Economy, Ecology, and Environment. I am currently working on 21st Century Industrial Policies and their implications for regional urbanization.

# Methods and Tools
I am a believer in Mixed Methods Research i.e. using thoughtful combinations of quantitative and qualitative research methods tailored to address pre-specified research questions. 

## _Quantitative Approaches and Tools_

Most quantitative questions I work on usually require a combination of:
- Analytical statistics
- Linear Regression (usually OLS)
- Random Forest Machine Learning. 

I largely rely on RStudio and NumPy for these. 

On other occasions where problem requirements aren't clearly specified up-front, I have also worked with:
- Factor Analysis (specifically, Exploratory Primary Component Analysis)
- Cluster Analysis

Mostly using RStudio. 

On rare occasions, I have also experimented with Neural Nets using TensorFlow in Google Colab, but I don't consider myself too qualified in this. 

My research on urbanization has also required me to engage with:
- Spatial Econometrics 
- Panel Data (with Two Time Periods) 
- Causal Inference using Natural Experiments 

Most of my spatial work is conducted with a combination of NumPy and RStudio and is recorded on Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, and Quarto. 

Lastly, I also engage in data visualization using:
- matplotlib (Python)
- ggplot2 (RStudio)
- dplyr (RStudio)
- Observable Notebooks 

## _Qualitative Approaches_
Most of my qualitative work consists of using the following methods:
- Semi-structured phenomonological interviews
- Field Observations and Transects
- Qualitative Coding
